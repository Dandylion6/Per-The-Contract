# Per the Contract

<i>This is a c++ game project made using SFML with no other external assets or libraries, developed within 3 months. All assets and code is made by me.</i>

The game is inspired by the game 'Papers, please' in layout. The objective of the game is to barter with customers inorder to keep your shop 
afloat. The 'contractor' will periodically assign orders for you to complete, finish them before the deadline at all cost or risk the 
termination of your business.

## Controls

Objects can be dragged around and pressed in game.

[F1] - Exit game.<br />
[0 - 9] & [Num0 - Num9] - Price tag printer input.<br />
[Backspace] & [-] - Clear price tag printer input.<br />
[Enter] - Print price tag.<br />

## Notes

<ins>This game has a game breaking bug.</ins> where the objects will be rendered behind everything when z index is updated. This is does not happen at random,
After a certain amount of customers have entered (not sure but this seems to be the pattern) then this behaviour is seen. I do not have enough time to 
debug this issue due time and the fact that this won't be an easy fix, I have had  other problems with render orders that I also fixed. 

I wasn't able to make as much as I wanted to, but due not being able to have my full attention on developing this I wasn't able to make a full game.
Still, thank you for taking the time to read this and playing the game. I have learned a lot in the past 4 months and enjoyed working on this project.
